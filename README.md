After downloading the patch archive, simply extract it into the game directory. This patch comes with built-in transcoding functionality, so there's no need to install an external transcoder.

Important usage notes:
- When you enter a new level and wish to save the initial state, you can save directly using the tool's save button without exiting the game normally.
- However, if you want to save mid-level, you need to exit the game normally before saving, then click “Resume” to continue playing.

The patch also includes modifications for HP, hunger, strength, and money, along with a locking feature—please use these functions with caution.
